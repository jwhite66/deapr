Worksheet,
,
Select samples,In this case we are comparing S13-S15 to S16-S18
,Assign the gene type by referencing the PC Genes worksheet (using VLOOKUP)
Set min value,Sort Select samples by gene type
,Copy protein coding genes into set min value worksheet
,Calculate maximum value for each gene and delete MAX < 1
,Change all values < 0.01 to 0.01
Apply DELV-SRMM logic,Cull out genes with low values and low fold changes
,   Delete any genes where both group averages are < 1
,   Delete any genes with fold change between -2 and +2
,Determine if they are DELV of SRMM candidates
,For DELV:
,   Look for cases in each group where the MAX/MIN if less than 2 (low variability)
,   We want to designate as KEEP (2 DELVs?) when both groups are DELVs
,For SRMM:
,   We want to designate SRMM genes as keep if:
,   The SRMM calculation is > 1.5 OR < -1.5 AND the minimum value in the higher group is > 1
Apply weights,Copy over the samples from the Apply DELV-SRMM logic 
,   where the 2 DELVs? is 'KEEP' OR the SRMM? Is 'KEEP'
,Calculate the absolute fold change and the absolute difference of the values
,Sort the absolute value of the fold change (descending) and apply a rank (starting with 1)
,Sort the absolute value of the FPKM difference (descending) and apply a rank (starting with 1)
,Combine 90% of the fold change rank with 10% of the difference rank to get the weighted rank
,   (We should probably make the % modifiable by the user)
